<p><strong>LONDON</strong> - I visited this city for eight days and I had a blast. The architecture was so unique and I loved the many accents heard throughout my time there. I spent a large chunk of my time at the numerous museums around the city. Admission was free so I made full use of it and spent several hours in each one. My favourite memory was scalping for tickets for a Champions League game at the Arsenal Emirates Stadium. This was highly illegal, and the fuzz was everywhere even on horseback. I was expecting the tickets to be fake but fortunately the ticket scanned and the turnstiles turned and I was in! The city was unfortunately heavily polluted and I could smell it the moment I exited the Tube.

<strong>STOCKHOLM</strong> - I had an old friend who lived in Stockholm and had an opportunity to visit him. He kindly allowed me to stay with him because hotels were hella expensive. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that most Swedes spoke fluent English and that I did not have to speak a lick of Swedish to get around. People rarely use paper currency anymore and largely rely on bank cards for everyday transactions so the wad of bills I was carrying screamed 'tourist'. It was also dreadfully cold even though it was early October. I was unprepared for the weather and froze my butt off.

I took a short ferry from Stockholm to Drottningholm Palace<i> (Drottningholms slott)</i>, the private residence of the royal family, that was built in the 16th century. The style and layout of the palace is heavily inspired by Versailles. At this time of year, the trees were turning into wonderful autumn colours.

<p>
Stockholm was a relaxing and slow-paced city but it's also very small compared to London. It was difficult to find things to do. Also it was too cold for me to enjoy walking around.
