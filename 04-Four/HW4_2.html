    <h3>A Short Story : The Arrogant Swans</h3>
    <p>
        This Short Story The Arrogant Swans is quite interesting to all the people. Enjoy reading this story.
        <br>In a far away kingdom, there was a river. This river was home to many golden swans. The swans spent most
        of their time on the banks of the river. Every six months, the swans would leave a golden feather as a fee for using the lake. The soldiers of the kingdom would collect the feathers and deposit them in the royal treasury.
        <br>One day, a homeless bird saw the river. “The water in this river seems so cool and soothing. I will make
        my home here," thought the bird.
        <br>As soon as the bird settled down near the river, the golden swans noticed her. They came shouting. “This
        river belongs to us. We pay a golden feather to the King to use this river. You can not live here."

    <h3>A Short Story : The Cunning Bats</h3>
    <p>
        This Short Story The Cunning Bats is quite interesting to all the people. Enjoy reading this story.
        <br>Many years ago, the members of the jungle did not have any King. The animals said, “The lion must be the
        <br>King of this jungle." While the birds said, “The Hawk must be the King." There were many discussions
        and debates, but no final decision could be taken.
        The bats were cunning. They approached the animal and said, “Since we too are animal, we would like our dear lion to be the King. He is surely the most powerful among us." And the animals thought that the bats were on their side.
