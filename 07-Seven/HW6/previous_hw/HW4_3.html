    <h3>A Short Story : The Arrogant Swans</h3>
    <p>
        This Short Story The Arrogant Swans is quite interesting to all the people. Enjoy reading this story.
        <br>In a far away kingdom, there was a river. This river was home to many golden swans. The swans spent most
        of their time on the banks of the river. Every six months, the swans would leave a golden feather as a fee for using the lake. The soldiers of the kingdom would collect the feathers and deposit them in the royal treasury.
        <br>One day, a homeless bird saw the river. “The water in this river seems so cool and soothing. I will make
        my home here," thought the bird.
        <br>As soon as the bird settled down near the river, the golden swans noticed her. They came shouting. “This
        river belongs to us. We pay a golden feather to the King to use this river. You can not live here."

    <h3>A Short Story : The Cunning Bats</h3>
    <p>
        This Short Story The Cunning Bats is quite interesting to all the people. Enjoy reading this story.
        <br>Many years ago, the members of the jungle did not have any King. The animals said, “The lion must be the
        <br>King of this jungle." While the birds said, “The Hawk must be the King." There were many discussions
        and debates, but no final decision could be taken.
        The bats were cunning. They approached the animal and said, “Since we too are animal, we would like our dear lion to be the King. He is surely the most powerful among us." And the animals thought that the bats were on their side.

    <h3>A Short Story : The Clever Fox</h3>
    <p>
        This Short Story The Clever Fox is quite interesting to all the people. Enjoy reading this story.

        <br>There once lived a crow. One day he was very hungry. He had not been able to get any food the previous day.
               “If I do not get anything to eat I will starve to death," he thought.
        <br>As the crow was searching for food, his eyes fell on a piece of bread. He quickly swooped down, picked it up
            and flew off. Far away in a lonely place he sat on a tree to enjoy the bread.
        <br>Just then a hungry fox saw the crow sitting on the tree holding the bread in his mouth. “Yummy! That bread looks delicious. What I would give to get that piece of bread," the fox thought.
        <br>The fox decided to use all his cunning means to get the piece of bread from the mouth of the crow. He sat under the tree. The crow saw him and thought, “I guess this fox wants to eat my bread. I shall hold it carefully." And he held on to the bread even more tightly.
        <br>The clever fox spoke to the crow politely. He said, “Hello friend! How are you?" But the crow did not say anything.
        <br>“Crows are such lovely birds. And you are very charming too," said the fox, flattering the crow.
        <br>Then the fox said," I have heard that besides being beautiful you also have a sweet voice. Please sing a song for me."
